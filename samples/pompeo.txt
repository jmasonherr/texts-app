just a few moments to wrap up this trip to India and Pakistan, my first visit to both countries as Secretary of State, and we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Modi here in just a little bit and are very much looking forward to that. His leadership along with that of President Trump have truly put the relationship between India and the United States on a good plane with an upward trajectory.
My meetings were all productive with each of the counterparts, and here in India I must say the kickoff of the 2+2 was pretty special, a historic level of relationship that the two countries have not previously had. And I think each of us valued the opportunity to have good, strong, candid discussions. We’ve had 70 years of diplomatic relationships with India, and it was important for the four of us to work together through this dialogue so that we can continue to keep these two relationships both intertwined and moving towards our set of shared objectives of the world’s two largest democracies.

We’re happy that we were able to announce two agreement with India, the COMCASA agreement, and we also agreed to enhance our military cooperation with India as our major defense partner.

In Pakistan yesterday, we agreed that it’s time to start delivering on our joint commitments. There was broad agreement between myself, Foreign Minister Qureshi, and Prime Minister Khan that we need to take steps that will deliver outcomes on the ground, allowing us to begin to build confidence and trust between our two countries.

I’ve also had fun. On both stops I’ve had the chance to meet with teams from our embassy – always the highlight of my trip to meet with our diplomats and our locally employed staff to deliver President Trump’s foreign policy priorities.

And with that, I’m happy to take a couple questions.

So as I’ve said consistently as we’ve been continuing to work with the North Koreans to deliver on the world’s demands, the UN Security Council resolutions, which demand a number of things from North Korea and from no one else. There’s only
As I’ve said before, I’m not going to talk about ongoing negotiations, discussions that we’re having, with the North Koreans. We will work – we will continue to work with them to deliver for the world, as against the UN Security Council resolutions, and for Chairman Kim to deliver on the commitment that he made to President Trump in Singapore now back on June 12th.country that has a commitment under those Security Council resolutions
So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that The New York Times, a liberal newspaper that has attacked this administration relentlessly, chose to print such a piece. And if that piece is true, if it’s accurate, if it’s actually – I think they described it as a senior administration official – they should not well have chosen to take a disgruntled, deceptive, bad actor’s word for anything and put it in their newspaper.
It’s sad more than anything else that our nation has come to where you have – again, if it is what it’s purported to be, it is sad that you have someone who would make that choice. I come from a place where, if you’re not in a position to execute the commander’s intent, you have a singular option: It is to leave. And this person – and said, according to The New York Times – chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do. And I ought to tell you, just I find – I find the media’s efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing.

Let me take the second one first. We have told the Indians consistently, as we have told every nation, that on November 4th the sanctions with respect to Iranian crude oil will be enforced, and that we will consider waivers where appropriate, but that it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will go to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed. So we’ll work with the Indians. We committed that we would do that. Many countries are in a place where they – it takes a little bit of time to unwind, and we’ll work with them, I am sure, to find an outcome that makes sense.

And from whence they purchase the other crude oil, we’re happy to see if it’s American products that are able to deliver for them. I think that’d be a great outcome. But our mission set is to make sure that Iran doesn’t engage in malign behavior with wealth that comes from countries around the world, thus the purpose of the sanctions.

On North Korea, no, I’m not going to talk about the negotiations and what the next steps might be. It is the case that there is still an enormous amount of work to do. We haven’t had any nuclear tests, we haven’t had any missile tests, which we consider a good thing. But the work of convincing Chairman Kim to make the strategic shift that we’ve talked about for a brighter future for the people of North Korea continues.
So I haven’t known her for a long time. I met her in person for the first time today, but we’ve spoken by phone previously. We have a good discussion, one that is marked by true candor. I think we both share our concerns in places where we think our two countries can work together to do better and create opportunity as well.

With respect to the S-400, no decision has been made. We are working to impose CAATSA Section 231 in a way that is appropriate and lawful and to exercise that waiver authority only where it makes sense. And we as a team, the national security team, will work on that, and as we continue to have these conversations with India about that, I think come to an outcome that makes sense for each of our two countries.

You had a third one.

Trade, yeah. Trade, very straightforward: free, fair, and reciprocal. We want the trade balance, the trade deficit that the United States has in its trade with India, to be rectified. They have made some progress on that, and we thank them for that. They’re going to buy more energy products from the United States. They’re going to purchase more aircraft from the United States. We truly do appreciate that. But the gap will remain, and so we are urging them to do all that they can to narrow that gap.

At the same time, it’s important that the trade barriers that are there, places that American companies’ and American workers’ products can’t be sold here, be reduced. And so very consistent what President Trump is seeking all around the world are the things we talked about with our Indian counterparts here today.

Yeah, I wouldn’t say that. I wouldn’t. There’s been no decision made. But I will share that we do understand the history, right, of India’s relationship with Russia and legacy systems. Our effort here, too, is not to penalize great strategic partners like India, a major defense partner. The sanctions aren’t intended to adversely impact countries like India. They are intended to be a – have an impact on the sanctioned country, which is Russia.

And so we’ll work our way through the waiver decision as the days and weeks proceed, and we’ll do that alongside our partner, India, as well.


(In progress) just a few moments to wrap up this trip to India and Pakistan, my first visit to both countries as Secretary of State, and we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Modi here in just a little bit and are very much looking forward to that.

And with that, I’m happy to take a couple questions.





So as I’ve said consistently as we’ve been continuing to work with the North Koreans to deliver on the world’s demands, the UN Security Council resolutions, which demand a number of things from North Korea and from no one else. There’s only country that has a commitment under those Security Council resolutions.

As I’ve said before, I’m not going to talk about ongoing negotiations, discussions that we’re having, with the North Koreans. We will work – we will continue to work with them to deliver for the world, as against the UN Security Council resolutions, and for Chairman Kim to deliver on the commitment that he made to President Trump in Singapore now back on June 12th.





So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that The New York Times, a liberal newspaper that has attacked this administration relentlessly, chose to print such a piece.

And this person – and said, according to The New York Times – chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do. And I ought to tell you, just I find – I find the media’s efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing.



And I’ll answer your other question directly, because I know someone will say, gosh, he didn’t answer the question. It’s not mine.



On North Korea, (inaudible) that Chairman Kim (inaudible) timeline for the first time in terms of when he would denuclearize. But at the same time, the U.S. intelligence assessment (inaudible) concluded that, actually, they were still working on a program (inaudible). And could you help us understand (inaudible) what next steps in light of the developments (inaudible)?

On India, was there a request to the Indians that they buy more U.S. oil and less Iranian oil?

Let me take the second one first. We have told the Indians consistently, as we have told every nation, that on November 4th the sanctions with respect to Iranian crude oil will be enforced, and that we will consider waivers where appropriate, but that it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will go to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed.

We haven’t had any nuclear tests, we haven’t had any missile tests, which we consider a good thing. But the work of convincing Chairman Kim to make the strategic shift that we’ve talked about for a brighter future for the people of North Korea continues.





Hi.



Be clever. Make it (a) and (b) and we’ll – it’ll all work.



So I haven’t known her for a long time. I met her in person for the first time today, but we’ve spoken by phone previously. We have a good discussion, one that is marked by true candor. I think we both share our concerns in places where we think our two countries can work together to do better and create opportunity as well.

And so very consistent what President Trump is seeking all around the world are the things we talked about with our Indian counterparts here today.



Great. Thanks, everybody. Go ahead, I’ll take one more. You look very forlorn. (Laughter.)



Yeah, I wouldn’t say that. I wouldn’t. There’s been no decision made. But I will share that we do understand the history, right, of India’s relationship with Russia and legacy systems. Our effort here, too, is not to penalize great strategic partners like India, a major defense partner. The sanctions aren’t intended to adversely impact countries like India. They are intended to be a – have an impact on the sanctioned country, which is Russia.

And so we’ll work our way through the waiver decision as the days and weeks proceed, and we’ll do that alongside our partner, India, as well.



Great. Thanks, everybody.


So a couple thoughts as we get started. First, from the trip, I think we accomplished the objectives we set out: a chance to meet a number of foreign ministers I’ve not met before; we got a chance to share with them three or four things, primarily the United States commitment to the region, something I spoke about a week ago now on Monday; to lay out for them a little more detail how it is the case we intend to ensure that the Indo-Pacific region is free and open. And I think they appreciated hearing that directly from me in private settings where we could talk about what that really meant for them and for their country.

The second, we got to bring them up to speed on the progress, places we haven’t made progress on North Korea, and our plan moving forward, including the need for each of them to continue to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions and what that meant and what our expectation was for every country who – part of the UN who had voted for those Security Council resolutions.

I’m happy – other questions – everybody saw there was an earthquake where we took off from, 7.0 earthquake in Indonesia just after we took off. I think 37 now reported – we don’t have confirmations, but multiple deaths.



Don’t have any – I don’t have any information beyond that yet. All of the government personnel are accounted for, but we don’t have confirmation whether there were American citizens there. Do you have any (inaudible)?



Yeah, I hadn’t seen anything yet either.

And then tomorrow’s an important day. I’ve talked a lot about the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Tomorrow the first set of waivers associated with the wind-down period after the President’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA will take effect. The White House will have an announcement sometime tomorrow morning about that, how we’re actually going to handle that as well, but it’s an important part of our efforts to push back against Iranian malign activity.

Anyway, there you go. There’s three thoughts. Happy (inaudible).



Yeah, so the President and I too have been very clear. We’re very hopeful that we can find a way to move forward, but it’s going to require enormous change on the part of the Iranian regime. They’ve got to – well, they’ve got to behave like a normal country. That’s the ask. It’s pretty simple. And so we think most other countries – everyone with whom I spoke understands that they need to behave normally, and they understand that this is a country that threatens them. Right, we’ve got assassinations taking place in Europe, we’ve got – I could go through the list of malign activity throughout the region. It’s – these folks are bad actors and the President is determined to change their direction. Of course, I think he said this morning, hey, we’re happy to talk if there’s an arrangement that is appropriate that can lead to a good outcome. Perhaps that’ll be the path the Iranians choose to move down. But there’s no evidence to date of their desire to change and behave in a more normal way.



The United States is going to enforce these sanctions. We’re going to enforce these sanctions. (Inaudible.) Just go look at the reporting on what’s taking place. The Iranian people are not happy – not with the Americans, but with their own leadership. They’re unhappy with the failure of their own leadership to deliver the economic promises that their leadership promised them. This isn’t – this is just about Iranians’ dissatisfaction with their own government, and the President’s been pretty clear. We want the Iranian people to have a strong voice in who their leadership will be.



Well, you compare it to last year.



Foreign minister made very clear their continued commitment to denuclearize. I think that was – I don’t – probably don’t have his words exactly right, but it’s pretty close. Compare the anger, frankly, over years and years, and hatred spewed by the North Koreans. This was – his comments were different, and put the comments aside for a minute. The mission statement’s very clear. The UN Security Council has said they must end their nuclear program and their ballistic missile program.



I’m sorry.



He’s got to deliver on the commitments he's made.



Yeah, you – your question has a predicate, and I’m just going to say there are lots of conversations taking place.



Lots of conversations taking place. You want to ask again?



Lots of conversations taking place.



Yeah. That’s right.



I know where you’re headed. I’m not going to comment on the negotiations and what others may have proffered or what we have considered. Just not appropriate. Wouldn’t be fair to them or to us as we try and solve this.







We’re still – we’re working our way through it.



Go ahead, yeah.



That’s – because it’s just not true. It’s just not true. Go look at who’s got all the tariffs and who the non-tariff barriers – it’s China. And the President is trying to reset that. The mission set that the President has set out is he – look, he’s said it: Zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, zero subsidies. How much more free and open one might – could one possibly be? That’s the President’s mission statement. The tariffs, the barriers, you see what they do to U.S. businesses who want to come operate in China. They deny them the same set of rules the Chinese businesses that want to come compete in America – we welcome them. We are open, and they need to be the same. We need fair and reciprocal responses from China. That’s what I told every one of my counterparts: America’s objective is to ensure that American businesses have the same opportunities to compete in their country that they have in ours, and when we get there, we’ll all go compete and we’ll have free and open trade amongst each of the countries, each of the –





I’ll take one more, then I’ll –





Yes.



No, no. Going to get Pastor Brunson home, that’s the mission. I think Ambassador Bolton[1] on the shows this morning said it right: We need to return Ambassador[2] Brunson to the United States. We should also remember every time we talk about Pastor Brunson there are other Americans still being held as well. We are as determined to get them home as we are Pastor Brunson. The local employees – want to get them out of the detention that they’re being held in as well. We are – we’re concerned about all of those folks and working our –



We’re working on it.



No, not that you haven’t seen in the press. Ambassador Bolton said this morning there wasn’t an American connection. We don’t really have a lot of detail about what took place beyond what you’ve seen and what the – I think the White House has put out so far.



All right. Thanks, everybody.



All right. We’ll see you on the other end.
(In progress) just a few moments to wrap up this trip to India and Pakistan, my first visit to both countries as Secretary of State, and we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Modi here in just a little bit and are very much looking forward to that. His leadership along with that of President Trump have truly put the relationship between India and the United States on a good plane with an upward trajectory.

I think we both share our concerns in places where we think our two countries can work together to do better and create opportunity as well.

And so we’ll work our way through the waiver decision as the days and weeks proceed, and we’ll do that alongside our partner, India, as well.



Great. Thanks, everybody.



And on North Korea you talked about – you called on them, so I’m thinking you actually met with the North Koreans here. Is that true? And you said earlier today that they – that Kim kind of controls the timeline of denuclearization, and so what do you want to see as the next major step there?

And finally, you’ve mentioned --



That’s six by my count.



So let me start with the first issue you raise, which is the U.S. relationship with China. President Trump desperately wants free, open, fair trade all across the world. All the work that we’re doing in the trade arena is designed exactly for that purpose. President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally or fairly by the Chinese, and the efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct that, to adjust that. And I talked with my Chinese counterpart about that yesterday. We also, of course, talked about the importance of enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions, and they made clear their continued commitment to do that.

Your second question was about North Korea and progress along the way. Chairman Kim made a commitment on June 12th in this very place. He said that he would denuclearize his country. We have been working since then to develop the process by which that will be achieved. We were heartened by the repatriation of the remains of 55 persons, a commitment that Chairman Kim has made. He made a commitment to begin the dismantlement of an engine test site. That work has begun.

The process of achieving denuclearization of North Korean – the North Korean peninsula is one that I think we have all known would take some time, but I must say from my meetings here the world is united in seeing this achieved. There has not been a single country that hasn’t thanked the United States for its efforts in moving the world towards the possibility of achieving this end-state goal. We’re determined to do it. Chairman Kim is committed to doing it. I am optimistic that we will get this done in the timeline and the world will celebrate what the UN Security Council has demanded.



Go ahead.



I’ve not met with the North Koreans.



I’ve not met with the North Koreans here.





I had a constructive conversation with my counterpart yesterday. I made clear that it is well past time that Pastor Brunson be free and be permitted to return to the United States, and the others behind held by Turkey also similarly must be freed as well. I am hopeful that in the coming days we will see that occur, and I don’t want to predict in the future what we might or might do to further enhance the likelihood that that occur. We had a good conversation. I’m very hopeful that we will make progress along that in the days and weeks ahead.

And more broadly, there are lots of challenges with Turkey but places that, frankly, I’ve worked closely with my foreign minister – the work that – their foreign minister. We’ve – we developed a roadmap for how we would proceed in Manbij – a very contentious issue that existed for a long time. We’ve not only achieved agreement but made actual progress on the ground in implementing that agreement. We’re working diligently, and Turkey is a NATO partner with whom the United States has every intention of continuing to work cooperatively.





Yes, ma’am. Precisely how that will play out will be up to each of the ASEAN countries to see how they will choose to participate in that. As I said, this has been my first trip here to ASEAN and to a ministerial meeting, but it’s not the first time I’ve interacted with nearly each of the countries, my counterparts with whom I’ve had the chance to meet during this trip.

What I have found from this ASEAN gathering is a deep commitment to work along the United States – along with the United States on the things that are important to each of their countries, to ASEAN, and to the United States. I’ve talked about them here this morning: a free and open Indo-Pacific, a place where every country can have true opportunity to compete, to transit their goods, in a way that is not dominated, not threatened by any one member of ASEAN or any country in the region. That’s important, and it is among those security and economic objectives are very much at the center of what ASEAN has stood for now for over five decades, and I think this particular ministerial moved that forward significantly as well.

Thank you, all.



Thank you, all. Have a great day.

Our men and women who were tasked to keep us safe in the aftermath of 9/11 — our military and our intelligence warriors — are heroes, not pawns in some liberal game being played by the ACLU and Senator Feinstein hese men and women are not torturers, they are patriots. The programs being used were within the law, within the constitution, and conducted with the full knowledge Senator Feinstein. If any individual did operate outside of the program’s legal framework, I would expect them to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

It is hard to imagine a sound reason that Senator Feinstein would put American operators and their families at risk—by demanding the release of details that are not in any way related to the legality or appropriateness of the programs. The intelligence collection programs described in the report have been in the news and hot topics for discussion for years. The sad conclusion left open is that her release of the report is the result of a narcissistic self-cleansing that is quintessentially at odds with her duty to the country.

Moreover, the release of this report makes our nation is less secure. Our friends and allies across the world, who have worked closely with us to crush the Islamic jihad that threatens every Kansan and every American, now know the United States government will not honor its commitments. Their willingness to work with us in the future is now greatly diminished.
