(i also cheated on her until she died.) i was only 79 and still going strong, but i decided no more wives for me-only compatible housekeepers.\"\nthe youngest respondents wrote from indiana: \"we're both 18, we've been married for three months but we went together for nearly three years, and we haven't cheated yet.\"\nthis heartwarming letter came from harrisburg, pa.: \"thanks for asking. i am proud to say that in the 45 years i've been married to this wonderful woman, i have never cheated. and this includes two years during which i served with the u.s. navy. i had no girl in any port! my upbringing and moral values would never have allowed me to live in peace should i have strayed. furthermore, i'm sure my wife can make the same statement.\"\nthe most surprising revelation in this survey was the number of male bisexuals that surfaced. although mental health professionals in the past have estimated that 10 percent of the population is either gay or bisexual, my survey indicated that there are possibly twice that number. many are married with \"fine families.\" \"i am a 67-year-old male who has been homosexual (or bi) since i can remember. because of the social pressures of living in a small iowa town in the '40s, i married and remained married until my wife died. while married, i cheated whenever i could find a willing partner.\"\nfrom a vermont wife: \"married 36 years, we both had extramarital affairs. all mine were heterosexual, but i'm not sure about his.\"\n\"i'm female, 49, now divorced. fourteen years ago i had an affair with a close friend of my husband's. it lasted three years-until i caught him in bed with my husband. that ended my affair and also my marriage.\"\nmany wrote at length to justify their affairs: \"i was married to a wonderful man for 38 years. did i cheat? you bet i did! my husband was great at a lot of things, but a lover he wasn't. back in those days nobody ever spoke about a woman's need to be satisfied. i mentioned it a few times-even bought him a book on lovemaking-but he just looked at the pictures. he's been dead for 13 years. i'm 72, and if i could find a decent man who wasn't after my money, i'd go for it!\"\nfrom albany, n.y.: \"have i ever cheated? yes. am i sorry? no! we've been married for 22 years. i'm 48, and 'miss untouchable' is 47, and she hasn't had her nightgown off in 10 years. she announced, 'we have our family now. i've done my duty, so don't bother me'!\"\nhere's an upper: \"my husband and i just celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary, and if our sex life was any better, we couldn't handle it. i was 19 and he was 22 when we married. we were both virgins. i swear sex is the fountain of youth. my mother told me that the way to a man's heart was through his stomach, but i think i found a shortcut.\"\ntomorrow: more quotes from the survey.",
