it's okay for abc to crash, kill, burn and maim dozens of tv victims every week, but when it comes to steven and luke getting physical, it's strictly a hands off affair.↵\"hill street blues,\" \"st. elsewhere\" and \"the love boat\" also have taken a fling lately with homosexual characters, but only in minor roles, and only in a minor key.↵\"consenting adult\" is major. it explores the subject without exploiting it. the only other major tv movies on the subject that have come close in the last 10 years, aghayan says, are \"that certain summer,\" with hal holbrook and martin sheen, and \"a question of love,\" with jane alexander and gena rowlands.↵\" 'that certain summer' was a leap ahead of anything else that had been done,\" aghayan says, \"but it still seemed to be a negative view of homosexuals. it ends up with holbrook's telling his son he was gay, and his being all weepy and upset and apologetic. i wanted to do something positive.↵\"to me 'consenting adult' isn't a story about homosexuality. it's a story about acceptance. and love. it's about how we can't change our children and make them over into extensions of ourselves. and it's not just about children, but friends, too. if you love someone, you accept them for who they are. you can't change them. it just doesn't work.\"↵what does work is facing the truth. but that takes time. in the novel it takes the mother 13 years. in the tv version marlo thomas goes from rejection to repulsion to reconciliation in about a year and a half. indeed, if there is one basic flaw in the film, it's that the mother's final, final acceptance of her son happens inside her head, off screen. thomas wishes more time had been given to the process, but overall, she is very pleased with the project.↵\"i beliehamily dares to tell the truth about himself--\"i am a homosexual\"--the whole family is shaken up.↵\"but the son's courage eventually gave the mother courage to stop telling her lies, to face up to the sexual problems in her marriage. the whole thing is we shouldn't try to 'cure' them. homosexuality is not a disease. we should just let people be.\"↵'consenting adult' to raise issues, but support is available↵several national gay and lesbian groups are commending, and recommending, \"consenting adult,\" at 8 p.m. monday on abc-ch. 7.↵in a mailing, the national gay task force has encouraged members to thank abc for airing it.↵\"it's a real coming out for tv,\" says a representative of the alliance for gay and lesbian artists (agla). the los angeles-based group calls the film \"an important tv event.\"↵in chicago these groups offer information and support on issues raised in \"consenting adult\":↵-- gay and lesbian horizons. a professional, peer hotline for young people concerned about their sexuality. call 929-help afte -- parents and friends of lesbians and gays (parent's flag). recommended by dear abby. the hotline number is 472-3079.↵-- coming out workshops. rick karlin and his mother offer a workshoheir parents. the two may be reached through the gay and lesbian horizons hotline, 929-help.↵caption:↵photo: barry tubb and marlo thomas: exploring without exploiting.↵illustration photo",

(i also cheated on her until she died.) i was only 79 and still going strong, but i decided no more wives for me-only compatible housekeepers.\"↵the youngest respondents wrote from indiana: \"we're both 18, we've been married for three months but we went together for nearly three years, and we haven't cheated yet.\"↵this heartwarming letter came from harrisburg, pa.: \"thanks for asking. i am proud to say that in the 45 years i've been married to this wonderful woman, i have never cheated. and this includes two years during which i served with the u.s. navy. i had no girl in any port! my upbringing and moral values would never have allowed me to live in peace should i have strayed. furthermore, i'm sure my wife can make the same statement.\"↵the most surprising revelation in this survey was the number of male bisexuals that surfaced. although mental health professionals in the past have estimated that 10 percent of the population is either gay or bisexual, my survey indicated that there are possibly twice that number. many are married with \"fine families.\" \"i am a 67-year-old male who has been homosexual (or bi) since i can remember. because of the social pressures of living in a small iowa town in the '40s, i married and remained married until my wife died. while married, i cheated whenever i could find a willing partner.\"↵from a vermont wife: \"married 36 years, we both had extramarital affairs. all mine were heterosexual, but i'm not sure about his.\"↵\"i'm female, 49, now divorced. fourteen years ago i had an affair with a close friend of my husband's. it lasted three years-until i caught him in bed with my husband. that ended my affair and also my marriage.\"↵many wrote at length to justify their affairs: \"i was married to a wonderful man for 38 years. did i cheat? you bet i did! my husband was great at a lot of things, but a lover he wasn't. back in those days nobody ever spoke about a woman's need to be satisfied. i mentioned it a few times-even bought him a book on lovemaking-but he just looked at the pictures. he's been dead for 13 years. i'm 72, and if i could find a decent man who wasn't after my money, i'd go for it!\"↵from albany, n.y.: \"have i ever cheated? yes. am i sorry? no! we've been married for 22 years. i'm 48, and 'miss untouchable' is 47, and she hasn't had her nightgown off in 10 years. she announced, 'we have our family now. i've done my duty, so don't bother me'!\"↵here's an upper: \"my husband and i just celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary, and if our sex life was any better, we couldn't handle it. i was 19 and he was 22 when we married. we were both virgins. i swear sex is the fountain of youth. my mother told me that the way to a man's heart was through his stomach, but i think i found a shortcut.\"↵tomorrow: more quotes from the survey."

    "letterID": 1,
    "text": "this story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts. this is part 2.↵i kept all the letters from readers pertaining to the divorce-more than 35,000 of them. why? i'm not sure. maybe because they were so beautiful. i couldn't throw them out. they are the only letters that i've ever kept. my readers told me not to think that because my marriage didn't last forever, i wasn't qualified to advise others. they said the experience would make me better qualified, and they were right.↵i don't know if writing the column and reading about other people's problems have affected the way i handle my own. i never confuse my identity with my readers. but i'm sure that what i have learned from them has given me strength. i've seen how people live through terrible tragedies and emerge stronger in the broken places. a divorce is nothing compared with the problems i see in my everyday mail. there are millions of people out there who have had rotten luck and fought their way back. the column has given me a healthy perspective and made me realize how fortunate i've been. i truly feel joined at the heart with my readers. i would rather have my column on 1,000 refrigerator doors than win a pulitzer.↵i don't have a great deal of time for hobbies, but i make it a point to take time for myself. my work is never finished. there is always so much to do. i could easily become a workaholic, so i see to it that i have a social life. i set aside \"play time,\" time for fun. i have interesting gentlemen friends. chicago has a fabulous symphony, the lyric opera and good theater. i've been blessed with friends who are marvelous to me. many single women, when they're divorced or widowed, are left out. that never happened to me. in addition to my chicago pals, i have friends who invite me to fabulous parties on both coasts and some cities in between. i've already penciled in a hot-air-balloon party in normandy, france, for next june.↵i visit my sisters in omaha and beverly hills, and i vacation with friends in greenwich, palm springs, martha's vineyard, southampton, palm beach, london, etc. i visit my daughter, margo, and her husband, ken, and the grandkids in connecticut, boston and minneapolis. we always have thanksgiving together. my family is a joy to me, the frosting on the cake.↵i'm often asked about my relationship with my twin sister, dear abby.↵it isn't true that we fight. we get along fine. all siblings are competitive and, being twins, we are probably more competitive than ordinary sisters. but she's a great girl with a marvelous sense of humor, and when we get together, our mouths never stop. we make each other laugh in a way that no one else can. we both have fax machines, and we fax each other like crazy. if i see a column of hers that i think is especially good, i'll tear it out and fax it to her with a note saying, \"this is great.\" she does the same for me. it's irritating to read that we aren't speaking. that is simply not true. professionally, we compete, but there are plenty of newspapers for both of us, and in some cities, her column and mine appear in the same paper. this does not bother either of us.↵this is a killer job. i often work 14 hours a day. i pick letters that demand a lot of me. it would be easy to print run-of-the-mill stuff, but i select letters that give me an opportunity to teach people something. this was my mission from the beginning. i have always viewed my column as an opportunity to educate. you cannot read my column regularly and not learn something.↵it always tickles me when i meet middle-aged people who say: \"you raised me. my mother used to put your column in my lunch bag and on my dinner plate. when i went away to college, she'd mail the damned things to me with a note saying, `read this!' now i'm mailing your column to my kids who are away at college, and i'm saying the same thing!\"↵in addition to being able to reach millions of people, the column has empowered me to do some real good in the world. for example, years ago i printed a column about the most feared word in the english language-cancer. there was a bill before congress designating $100 million for cancer research. it needed president nixon's signature. i asked my readers to clip the column and send it to washington. well-all hell broke loose. more than a million pieces of mail hit washington. capitol hill had never seen anything like it. no politician could afford to ignore that kind of pressure. president nixon signed the national cancer act in 1971, and we got the money.↵it's been said that you can tell a lot about a person by the enemies they've made. it's true. not everybody loves me. for a long time now i've been battling some mighty powerful opponents.↵as a strong supporter of planned parenthood and a woman's right to choose, i receive a lot of ugly mail from the anti-abortion people. i also get nasty letters from members of the national rifle association. the number of people killed by handguns in this country is appalling. i am now fighting for the brady bill, which would require a seven-day waiting period before a person can buy a handgun. the nra says it would be \"inconvenient.\" my position is that anyone who is in that big a hurry to get a gun shouldn't have one.↵the animal-rights people would also dearly love to see me drop into a very deep hole. i believe it is absolutely imperative that animals be used to further medical research. for example, experiments using monkeys are essential to unlock the mysteries of the aids virus. animal-rights activists have broken into laboratories, let the monkeys out of the cages, smashed expensive equipment and destroyed research. i call these zealots \"terrorists.\" the names they call me cannot be printed in a family newspaper.↵i receive approximately 2,000 letters daily. no one screens the mail for me. i select all the letters that go into the column, and i do all my own writing. there are no little ghosts sitting at my typewriter. i have a staff of eight secretaries and two mail clerks. they are the most dedicated, hardest-working people i know. my office runs like a well-oiled machine. the amount of work they turn out every day is simply staggering. i could never do the job half as well without these incredible assistants.↵after all these years, i still attack every batch of mail with enthusiasm. i guess i must be a little crazy, but i continue to be excited by this work. some of the handwriting is terrible, but i've become a master at hieroglyphics. the number of people who write to me just to unload is surprising. they will go on for 12 or 14 pages, and then i find there is no name or address. they end the letter by saying: \"thanks for letting me get this off my chest, ann. i feel a lot better now.\"↵i am well aware that a life that has been messed up for 20 years cannot be straightened out with one letter from ann landers or two inches of newspaper space. many people who write to me need a lot more help than i can give them. the most important thing i do is something that many readers don't ever know about. i refer people to service agencies so they can get the kind of ongoing help they need.↵we have, on computer, the addresses and telephone numbers of hundreds of service agencies and self-help groups in the u.s. and canada. people need to know how to get in touch with alcoholics anonymous, catholic charities, the lutheran family services and the jewish federation. they need to know about the drug-abuse centers, the support groups and the toll-free hot lines for the depressed and the suicidal and for rape victims, battered women and missing children. most of the self-help groups cost nothing to join. they extend a warm welcome to anyone who shows up. but people need to know they exist and how to contact them. telling them is the best thing i do.↵i am often asked if all the letters that appear in my column are on the level. people frequently say, \"some of those letters are so fantastic, i think you make them up.\" let me assure you that every letter that appears in my column is real.↵the most frequent problems i get are about personal relationships. among the toughest of these involve women who are married to or living with men who are abusive, unfaithful, alcoholic or drug-addicted. they say: \"don't tell me to leave him because i can't. and don't suggest joint counseling. he won't go.\"↵so what is there left to tell them? i say: \"the only way a relationship will get better is if both people work at it. if he refuses to work at it and you insist on staying with him, there is nothing i can do to help you.\" i then suggest that she ask herself that famous ann landers question, \"would your life be better with him or without him?\" many women have written back to say: \"thank you, ann. i've decided i'd be better off without him, and i'm kicking the bum out.\"↵how do the letters today compare with the letters i received 35 years ago? well, for one thing, the problems i am hearing about today are more disturbing. they reflect a serious deterioration of american family life. marriage is no longer viewed as a lifelong commitment. fifty percent of all couples who marry today will end up divorced. the average marriage lasts seven years. americans have the highest divorce rate in the world.↵there's a great deal of guilt on the part of working mothers. they are ambivalent about leaving young children. they write: \"it kills me to leave my 2- and 4-year-old kids at the day-care center every morning, but i have to work. i have no choice.\" and then there are the women who feel guilty about staying home. they worked hard to get their m.b.a.'s and gave up lucrative jobs for motherhood. \"the woman who replaced me is now making $60,000 a year,\" writes mrs. x of morristown, n.j. \"when i go back to work two years from now, i'll have to take considerably less. i really resent this, and i try not to take it out on the kids, but i'm not sure i'm succeeding.\"↵i hear a lot about drug abuse. it is ruining millions of lives. now we have crack, which is cheap, easy to get and dangerously addictive. the drug problem has created overcrowded prisons and jammed our criminal-justice system. assaults and murders, clearly drug-connected, have reached an all-time high in new york, chicago, detroit, miami and los angeles. teenage gangs and drive-by shootings have made the streets unsafe. babies have been shot in their mother's arms.↵at one time i seriously considered speaking out for the legalization of drugs but decided against it. after considerable soul-searching, i concluded that legalization would lead to a whole new set of problems. can you imagine what life would be like if surgeons, bus drivers, pilots, air-traffic controllers, teachers, nurses, firemen and policemen were on drugs? and it would be legal!↵i have had a ringside seat to life, and the changes i have seen would twirl your turban. thirty-five years ago a paper in michigan refused to print a column i had written about homosexuality. today same-sex couples want the financial benefits that married couples have, tax breaks, hospital visitation and home ownership. i agree that they should have them. the world is moving so fast these days that i am running as fast as i can to keep up with the changes. it's exhausting, but it's exciting. i frankly admit, however, that i'm glad i have already lived the greater part of my life. i'm not sure i would want to be around 50 years from now.↵a few months ago on a tv show in seattle, i was asked where i get the energy to do this job. i replied: \"i honestly don't know. i think it must come from some place outside of me.\" i believe that is true. i have never been a deeply religious person, but i have always had a strong and abiding faith. when i look at what my life has been like and the gifts i've been given, i know i did not do all this myself. every night before i go to sleep, i read something from the old testament, and i pray that i can give back a small part of what has been given to me.↵what are my plans for the future? where am i going from here? no place. i have no plans to retire. i intend to write the column as long as i have all my marbles and the strength to do the job. i still exercise 40 minutes every morning, and i feel marvelous. i will probably slump over at my typewriter when i am 90, and that will be it. at least that is the way i would like it to be.↵illustration photos 20 caption: photo by bob fila. far left: with twin pauline

    "question_old": "this story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts. this is part 2.↵i kept all the letters from readers pertaining to the divorce-more than 35,000 of them. why? i'm not sure. maybe because they were so beautiful. i couldn't throw them out. they are the only letters that i've ever kept. my readers told me not to think that because my marriage didn't last forever, i wasn't qualified to advise others. they said the experience would make me better qualified, and they were right.↵i don't know if writing the column and reading about other people's problems have affected the way i handle my own. i never confuse my identity with my readers. but i'm sure that what i have learned from them has given me strength. i've seen how people live through terrible tragedies and emerge stronger in the broken places. a divorce is nothing compared with the problems i see in my everyday mail. there are millions of people out there who have had rotten luck and fought their way back. the column has given me a healthy perspective and made me realize how fortunate i've been. i truly feel joined at the heart with my readers. i would rather have my column on 1,000 refrigerator doors than win a pulitzer.↵i don't have a great deal of time for hobbies, but i make it a point to take time for myself. my work is never finished. there is always so much to do. i could easily become a workaholic, so i see to it that i have a social life. i set aside \"play time,\" time for fun. i have interesting gentlemen friends. chicago has a fabulous symphony, the lyric opera and good theater. i've been blessed with friends who are marvelous to me. many single women, when they're divorced or widowed, are left out. that never happened to me. in addition to my chicago pals, i have friends who invite me to fabulous parties on both coasts and some cities in between. i've already penciled in a hot-air-balloon party in normandy, france, for next june.↵i visit my sisters in omaha and beverly hills, and i vacation with friends in greenwich, palm springs, martha's vineyard, southampton, palm beach, london, etc. i visit my daughter, margo, and her husband, ken, and the grandkids in connecticut, boston and minneapolis. we always have thanksgiving together. my family is a joy to me, the frosting on the cake.↵i'm often asked about my relationship with my twin sister, dear abby.↵it isn't true that we fight. we get along fine. all siblings are competitive and, being twins, we are probably more competitive than ordinary sisters. but she's a great girl with a marvelous sense of humor, and when we get together, our mouths never stop. we make each other laugh in a way that no one else can. we both have fax machines, and we fax each other like crazy. if i see a column of hers that i think is especially good, i'll tear it out and fax it to her with a note saying, \"this is great.\" she does the same for me. it's irritating to read that we aren't speaking. that is simply not true. professionally, we compete, but there are plenty of newspapers for both of us, and in some cities, her column and mine appear in the same paper. this does not bother either of us.↵this is a killer job. i often work 14 hours a day. i pick letters that demand a lot of me. it would be easy to print run-of-the-mill stuff, but i select letters that give me an opportunity to teach people something. this was my mission from the beginning. i have always viewed my column as an opportunity to educate. you cannot read my column regularly and not learn something.↵it always tickles me when i meet middle-aged people who say: \"you raised me. my mother used to put your column in my lunch bag and on my dinner plate. when i went away to college, she'd mail the damned things to me with a note saying, `read this!' now i'm mailing your column to my kids who are away at college, and i'm saying the same thing!\"↵in addition to being able to reach millions of people, the column has empowered me to do some real good in the world. for example, years ago i printed a column about the most feared word in the english language-cancer. there was a bill before congress designating $100 million for cancer research. it needed president nixon's signature. i asked my readers to clip the column and send it to washington. well-all hell broke loose. more than a million pieces of mail hit washington. capitol hill had never seen anything like it. no politician could afford to ignore that kind of pressure. president nixon signed the national cancer act in 1971, and we got the money.↵it's been said that you can tell a lot about a person by the enemies they've made. it's true. not everybody loves me. for a long time now i've been battling some mighty powerful opponents.↵as a strong supporter of planned parenthood and a woman's right to choose, i receive a lot of ugly mail from the anti-abortion people. i also get nasty letters from members of the national rifle association. the number of people killed by handguns in this country is appalling. i am now fighting for the brady bill, which would require a seven-day waiting period before a person can buy a handgun. the nra says it would be \"inconvenient.\" my position is that anyone who is in that big a hurry to get a gun shouldn't have one.↵the animal-rights people would also dearly love to see me drop into a very deep hole. i believe it is absolutely imperative that animals be used to further medical research. for example, experiments using monkeys are essential to unlock the mysteries of the aids virus. animal-rights activists have broken into laboratories, let the monkeys out of the cages, smashed expensive equipment and destroyed research. i call these zealots \"terrorists.\" the names they call me cannot be printed in a family newspaper.↵i receive approximately 2,000 letters daily. no one screens the mail for me. i select all the letters that go into the column, and i do all my own writing. there are no little ghosts sitting at my typewriter. i have a staff of eight secretaries and two mail clerks. they are the most dedicated, hardest-working people i know. my office runs like a well-oiled machine. the amount of work they turn out every day is simply staggering. i could never do the job half as well without these incredible assistants.↵after all these years, i still attack every batch of mail with enthusiasm. i guess i must be a little crazy, but i continue to be excited by this work. some of the handwriting is terrible, but i've become a master at hieroglyphics. the number of people who write to me just to unload is surprising. they will go on for 12 or 14 pages, and then i find there is no name or address. they end the letter by saying: \"thanks for letting me get this off my chest, ann. i feel a lot better now.\"↵i am well aware that a life that has been messed up for 20 years cannot be straightened out with one letter from ann landers or two inches of newspaper space. many people who write to me need a lot more help than i can give them. the most important thing i do is something that many readers don't ever know about. i refer people to service agencies so they can get the kind of ongoing help they need.↵we have, on computer, the addresses and telephone numbers of hundreds of service agencies and self-help groups in the u.s. and canada. people need to know how to get in touch with alcoholics anonymous, catholic charities, the lutheran family services and the jewish federation. they need to know about the drug-abuse centers, the support groups and the toll-free hot lines for the depressed and the suicidal and for rape victims, battered women and missing children. most of the self-help groups cost nothing to join. they extend a warm welcome to anyone who shows up. but people need to know they exist and how to contact them. telling them is the best thing i do.↵i am often asked if all the letters that appear in my column are on the level. people frequently say,

    "question_only": "i am hoping that you will be able to answer a question that has been bothering me for years. what is a \"gay lifestyle\"?↵i am a 40-year-old gay male and don't have a clue as to what a gay lifestyle is. my life partner, david, and i have been together 15 years and have jointly adopted three special-needs children. we live in the suburbs in a middle-class neighborhood, at the end of a cul-de-sac. like most of our gay and lesbian friends, we don't smoke, drink alcohol or go to bars. our children go to public school with the rest of the children in the neighborhood.↵once a friend told me what he thought was a gay lifestyle, but by the sound of it, he was describing a single's lifestyle, gay or straight. is that what some people mean, that is, a gay lifestyle is synonymous with a single lifestyle?↵if there is such a thing as a gay lifestyle, doesn't that automatically mean that there is a \"heterosexual lifestyle\"? and if this is true, what is a heterosexual lifestyle? i have sincerely been asking people and no one has been able to give me an answer. -- michael serkin-poole, bellevue, wash."
